    <p class="lead">The original idea of the web was that it should be a collaborative space where you can communicate through sharing information.</p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>Even though it has been years, Tim Berners-Lee has been able to see his project grow into something greater than he ever thought it would be today. His impact keeps him still involved, hes been working as a director for two of the organizations he has founded; the W3C Commission, and the World Wide Web Foundation. He also Computer Science at the University of Oxford and MIT.</p>

            <p class="card-text">The Consortium is something that Berners-Lee founded at MIT after creating the World Wide Web in 1994 for the public. The initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium was made for the ability to regulate guidelines and protocols for the World Wide Web to be what it is today. It was created to ensure the growth of the Web as a whole. Even though he founded it, since then Berners-Lee has taken over as a director to still be involved in his creation.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Teaching at Oxford and MIT</h5>
            <p class="card-text">After his creation, Berners-Lee wanted to impact the world as a whole. Since his initiaive of the W3C, Berners-Lee migrated to the United States where he has been teaching computer science to some of the best students in the world. What better way is there to change the world then to impact the youth by teaching them the ins of out of something that he created. More recently, he has also became a professor at the University of Oxford. He currently is a professor for both universities, spreading his knowledge across the masses.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">World Wide Web Foundation</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The World Wide Web Foundation was created in 2009 by Berners-Lee himself. Berners-Lee created the foundation to advance the web as a public good and basic right. The mission of the World Wide Web Foundation today is to protect consumers rights for their use of the internet, creating it a basic freedom of digital equality. In a letter written by Berners-Lee himself in 2018, he states that "50% of the world still not online and to ensure they find a web worth connecting to.". Berners-Lee is still heavily involved as this was founded recently as you can see from his letter statement. He wants everyone to be able to enjoy and use the internet as he intended.</p>
