    <p>Tim Berners-Lee was born on June 8, 1955 in London, UK. He received his degree in Physics at the University of Oxford in 1976. After graduation he worked for multiple companies, finally working as an independent contractor at CERN where his knowledge skyrocketed. His parents helped to create the first commercial computer, making Berners-Lee fascinated about the idea of using computers at a very young age. He still kept this in the back of his mind during his time at University, even though at the time there was nothing focused for computers because they were still early on in development. </p>

                <p class="card-text">At CERN, Berners-Lee started off in 1980. He was used as a private contractor in Switzerland. His job at CERN included sending information to other researchers in different countries. To streamline this process, Berners-Lee thought it would be best to use hypertext, which is sharing text electronically.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Proposal of Internet</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Berners-Lee created his proposal of the internet to help his project involving hypertext. He knew that these things already existed but he wanted to figure out how to integrate them all together. "I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the TCP and DNS ideas and — ta-da!— the World Wide Web.” -Tim Berners-Lee. Obviously it wasn't as easy as this but with this thought process he was able to create something that we all use on a daily basis.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Berners-Lee is still involved in the upkeep of the Internet even in his latter days. He is the founder and current director for the World Wide Web Consortium, where they create the standards for the Internet and the World Wide Web. His love for his creation has brought him to continue teaching at the University of Oxford and at Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a professor of Computer Science. </p>
