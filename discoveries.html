    <p>Tim Berners-Lee created his proposal on November 12th, 1990 that changed the way that everyone transfers data and information. The proposal was created to make it easier for his time at CERN but it evidently made a platform for everyone that most individuals use on a daily basis. His initial proposal to his CERN colleagues was called "Information Management: A Proposal. This document was created as a way for CERN to take all of their valuable information and have it able to be accessed from any computer. So he proposed to create a networked hypertext system.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Hypertext Implementation(1989)</h5>
            <p class="card-text">For his initial proposal to work with his colleagues, he had to bring something that they understand. They already used hypertext but not to a scale where it is accessible from across different networks. Using hypertext they noticed something that was already accessible to them which made the proposal realistic. The proposal was solid, but as people didn't know how it would work out, Berners-Lee had to create a more detailed proposal for it to be widely accepted throughout the community. His boss even stated "Vague but exciting" when speaking about the project, making Berners-Lee create a more detailed proposal. </p>

            <p class="card-text">The Proposal in 1990 was called: The World Wide Web. It was a major breakthrough as it was a proposal for HyperText project that would actually be accepted. Directly from the proposal Berners-Lee states "firstly we make use of existing software and hardware as well as implementing simple browsers for the user's workstations, based on an analysis of the requirements for information access needs by experiments. Secondly, we extend the application area by also allowing the users to add new material." The first part of the project was creating the framework, while the second part showed the future of computers without him even knowing it.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Internet Creation</h5>
            <p class="card-text">After the proposal was accepted at CERN, Berners-Lee started to implement the project immediately after. After he started, the project was created by December in 1990 and was used by CERN in a basic bare-bones form. The project was created through HTTP, URI, and HTML; things that are used in the framework of the World Wide Web today. On April 30th 1993, the World Wide Web software was released to the public, and Berners-Lee was able to see his idea on a greater scale. </p>
